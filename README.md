Transformy
==========

Object-oriented linear and nonlinear coordinate system transforms.

* A collection of different types of coordinate system transform classes
* Easy methods for mapping coordinate data through these transforms
* Transform composition and simplification
* Automatic generation of composite transforms from a coordinate system graph
* Coordinate arrays that know which coordinate system they live in to handle automatic mapping
 

Todo
====

* import bilinear, SRT transforms from pyqtgraph
* make transforms N-D wherever possible
* import coordinate system graph handling from vispy
* make coordinate system dimensionality explicit
* unit tests against ITK output
